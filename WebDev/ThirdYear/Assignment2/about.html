        <div class="faq_body">
          <p>
            We started as a small business in 2006. Our primary line of work then was breaking bikes for parts. Since then our
            business has grown exponentially and we have branched out into various lines of work. We now do everything from supplying bike
            parts worldwide to servicing and repairing machinery on-site.
            We even have our own Motocross team! So rest assured we are total petrol heads, just like yourself!

          <p>
            Absolutely not! We have a fully stocked store on-site. We offer a range of motorcycle gear from top-tier brands.
            We stock both on-road and off-road gear such as boots, gloves, textiles, leathers, jerseys and helmets!
            If there is something in particular you are looking for, we can order with next day delivery at competitive prices
            that won't be beaten!
