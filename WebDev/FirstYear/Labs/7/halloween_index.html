    <h2>Welcome to my site.  Please come in and stay awhile</h2>
    <p>
      I started this website because Halloween has always been my favourite holiday.  But during the last year, I started selling some of my favourite Halloween products,
      and they've become quite a hit.

      things Halloween.
